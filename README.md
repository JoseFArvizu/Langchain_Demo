# üß† Simple LangChain Demo

This project demonstrates a basic usage of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to interact with large language models through a custom Python notebook. It is intended for educational or experimental use with OpenAI's API.

## üìÅ Files

- `Simple_Langchain.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use LangChain to run a simple chatbot-style prompt with memory.
- `config.py`: Stores your OpenAI API key securely.

## üöÄ Features

- Integrates LangChain's `ConversationChain` for interactive AI responses.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model via the `OpenAI` LangChain wrapper.
- Tracks conversation history with `ConversationBufferMemory`.
- API key is externalized for better security and flexibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install langchain openai
```

We also recommend installing Jupyter if you're not using an IDE that supports notebooks:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## üîê API Key Setup

Update the `config.py` file with your actual OpenAI API key:

```python
api_key = 'your_openai_api_key_here'
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never share your actual API key publicly.**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `Simple_Langchain.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
3. Run the notebook step by step. It will:
   - Load your API key
   - Initialize the OpenAI LLM and LangChain memory
   - Allow you to chat with the LLM using conversational context
